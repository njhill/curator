h1. Welcome to Apache Curator

h2. What is Curator?

Apache Curator is a Java/JVM client library for [[Apache ZooKeeper|https://zookeeper.apache.org/]], a distributed coordination service.

Apache Curator includes a high-level API framework and utilities to make using Apache ZooKeeper much easier and more reliable. It also includes recipes for common use cases and extensions such as service discovery and a Java 8 asynchronous DSL.

h2. Getting Started

See the page for quick start: [[Getting Started|getting-started.html]].

h2. Components

|[[Recipes|curator-recipes/index.html]]|Implementations of some of the common ZooKeeper "recipes". The implementations are built on top of the Curator Framework.|
|[[Framework|curator-framework/index.html]]|The Curator Framework is a high\-level API that greatly simplifies using ZooKeeper. It adds many features that build on ZooKeeper and handles the complexity of managing connections to the ZooKeeper cluster and retrying operations.|
|[[Utilities|utilities.html]]|Various utilities that are useful when using ZooKeeper.|
|[[Client|curator-client/index.html]]|A replacement for the bundled {{ZooKeeper}} class that takes care of some low\-level housekeeping and provides some useful utilities.|
|[[Errors|errors.html]]|How Curator deals with errors, connection issues, recoverable exceptions, etc.|
|Extensions|The curator\-recipes package implements the common recipes that are described in the ZooKeeper documentation. To avoid bloating that package, recipes/applications that have a vertical appeal will be put in separate "extension" packages using the naming convention curator\-x\-name.|

h2. Maven / Artifacts

Curator binaries are published to Maven Central. Curator consists of several artifacts. Which artifacts to use depends on your needs. For
most users, the only artifact you need is curator\-recipes.

||GroupID/Org||ArtifactID/Name||Description||
|org.apache.curator|curator\-recipes|All of the recipes. Note: this artifact has dependencies on client and framework and, so, Maven (or whatever tool you're using) should pull those in automatically.|
|org.apache.curator|curator\-framework|The Curator Framework high level API. This is built on top of the client and should pull it in automatically.|
|org.apache.curator|curator\-client|The Curator Client \- replacement for the ZooKeeper class in the ZK distribution.|
|org.apache.curator|curator\-test|Contains the TestingServer, the TestingCluster and a few other tools useful for testing.|
|org.apache.curator|curator\-examples|Example usages of various Curator features.|
|org.apache.curator|curator\-x\-discovery|A Service Discovery implementation built on the Curator Framework.|
|org.apache.curator|curator\-x\-discovery-server|A RESTful server that can be used with Curator Discovery.|
|org.apache.curator|curator\-x\-rpc|A proxy that bridges non\-java environments with the Curator framework and recipes.|
